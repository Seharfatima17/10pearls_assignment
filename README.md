This repository contains a collection of Quality Assurance assignments that cover various concepts and practical tasks in software testing. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate key skills of a QA professional including manual testing, automation testing, bug reporting and performance testing. Each assignment inside this repository helps build real-world understanding of testing processes and tools used in the industry.

The assignments include QA theory, writing detailed test plans, creating test cases, reporting bugs professionally, performing API testing using Postman, and running performance testing with JMeter. Additionally, there is a sample automation project demonstrating UI test execution with tools like Sauce Labs. All files are organized to make it easy to understand and explore different areas of software testing.

Tools used in this work include Postman for API automation, JMeter for load and performance testing, Microsoft Excel for bug reporting, and PDF/Doc formats for test documentation. These assignments reflect practical learning and development of QA skills that are essential for working in professional testing environments.

This repository represents my learning journey as a Software Quality Assurance student, where I practice and apply different testing techniques. It highlights my ability to design test documentation, analyze results, detect defects, automate requests and evaluate system performance. I will continue to update this repository as I grow in the QA field.
